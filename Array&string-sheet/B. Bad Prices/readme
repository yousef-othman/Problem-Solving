Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n
 last days: a1,a2,…,an
, where ai
 is the price of berPhone on the day i
.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i
 to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6
 and a=[3,9,4,6,7,5]
, then the number of days with a bad price is 3
 — these are days 2
 (a2=9), 4
 (a4=6) and 5
 (a5=7).
